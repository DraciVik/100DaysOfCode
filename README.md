# 100DaysOfCode
This is where I'll keep my daily logs of the 100 days of code challenge

## Day - 0 - 28.07.2018
I made an instagram account where I'll put pictures of my progress and connect with likeminded people.
From tomorrow I'll start working on some projects. Probably will start from the freeCodeCamp ones and work myself upwards. Till tomorrow!

## Day - 1 - 29.07.2018
I started the Tribute page project from freeCodeCamp. Added the HTML. Only CSS left for the project. I plan on finishing the CSS tomorrow

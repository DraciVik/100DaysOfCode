# 100DaysOfCode

Round 2 ready to start from 08.11.2018

## Day - 1 - 08.11.2018

Today I watched a couple of videos on React and did some of the functional programming challenges on #freeCodeCamp Looking forward to being more active on this round 2. The first 100 days were good even though I neglected to post daily on twitter.

## Day - 2 - 09.11.2018

Decided that I'll need to start applying to new jobs around February or March so I can change careers so I enrolled in a specialization course on React on Coursera. Watched trough some of the tutorials.

## Day - 3 - 10.11.2018

Worked trough some tutorials on npm and git. I thought it would be boring since I was familiar with both, but I actually learned a thing or two. Also solved a 6kyu kata on codewars.

## Day - 4 - 11.11.2018

Finished all the videos from week one of a course on Coursera. I plan on finishing the assignment on day 5.

## Day - 5 - 12.11.2018

Messed around with bootstrap for a bit and downloaded a few tutorials about bootstrap to binge watch when I have time. Tried my hand again with functional programming and I'm getting a better understanding at each try

## Day - 6 - 13.11.2018

Solved my first weeks assignment from Coursera

## Day - 7 - 14.11.2018

Solved a couple of codewars challenges and a few freeCodeCamp functional programming

## Day - 8 - 15.11.2018

I did a few codewars challenges and went trough a lot of medium publications. Also worked on my assignments. I'm relearning some basic stuff right now cuz I feel myself forgetting them after not using such technologies after a few weeks.

## Day - 9 - 16.11.2018

Had some free time while at work and took some notes while I was watching a course. After that I solved a few challenges on codewars and freeCodeCamp and had the intention to continue after work. Yet I fell asleep and keep at it strong for 14hours

## Day - 10 - 17.11.2018

Followed trough the week 2 of my coursera course.

## Day - 11 - 18.11.2018

Practiced bootstrap today.

## Day - 12 - 19.11.2018

Went trough the whole bootstrap documentation then tried to implement the framework. It looks too easy so far. Is bootstrap ever used in deployment or just for quick wireframes to show a client?

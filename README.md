# 100DaysOfCode
This is where I'll keep my daily logs of the 100 days of code challenge

## Day - 0 - 28.07.2018
I made an instagram account where I'll put pictures of my progress and connect with likeminded people.
From tomorrow I'll start working on some projects. Probably will start from the freeCodeCamp ones and work myself upwards. Till tomorrow!

## Day - 1 - 29.07.2018
I started the Tribute page project from freeCodeCamp. Added the HTML. Only CSS left for the project. I plan on finishing the CSS tomorrow

## Day - 2 - 30.07.2018
Finished the Tribute page project from freeCodeCamp.
Finished with adding the CSS. All in all it was a quick easy project. Next up is the build a survey form.

## Day - 3 - 31.07.2018
Started the Survey Form project from freeCodeCamp.
Started adding the input fields. I also added my first instagram picture. It was of the finished Tribute page project.

## Day - 4 - 01.08.2018
Finished the HTML of the Survey Form. It passes all the test from codepen so technically the challenge is done. It loks ugly tho so I'll spend some time with CSS on it.

## Day - 5 - 02.08.2018
Finished the CSS for the Survey Form. Now it's not as ugly. Still ugly tho.

## Day - 6 - 03.08.2018
Started a new project - Product landing page. This one requires of me to use media queries and flexbox. Today I just wrote the HTML for the page with some placeholder text. Tomorrow is Saturday and I'm off from work so I'll spend a bit more time on this project so I can finish it. 

## Day - 7 - 04.08.2018
Today I took some refreshment on CSS flexbox. Previously I got so into JavaScript and React that I have forgotten how to use it. I spent couple of hours going trough the freeCodeCamp section on CSS Flexbox and watched some Wes Bos clips for it too. I think I have it now. I meddled with the CSS for the Product Landing Page challenge but I did not like it one bit so I scraped my progress. I will work on it the next day.

## Day - 8 - 05.08.2018
Added flexbox to my navigation and the submit form. In the meantime I solved all the responsive design challenges from freeCodeCamp. Was a good reminder especially the part about transitions and animations. I need to practice that more often

## Day - 9 - 06.08.2018
Messed with flexbox a bit more.

## Day - 10 - 07.08.2018
Joined a webinar and listened to it for an hour. Seemed like a waste of time tbh. I'm almost done with my Product Landing Page project. Should have completed it last night but the webinar took time away from me.

## Day - 11 - 08.08.2018
Took a sidetrack and practiced the parallax effect today.

## Day - 12 - 09.08.2018
Today I only watched YouTube videos. Got sleepy after a long day at work and around 7 PM I decided to get a power nap. That nap turned into a 12 hour sleep where I woke up just in time to get ready for work. I'm not sure if I should count this day or not but I saw lots of people counting days where they only watched tutorials and did not do any coding so I will too for today.

## Day - 13 - 10.08.2018
Found out a friend of mine from when I was in the USA has passed away from Lupus. I worked on my Product Landing Page for a bit before deciding to call it quits. Decided to scrap all the CSS I did and do it again from the basics. 

## Day - 14 - 11.08.2018
Today I enjoyed myself. Went to an Aqua Park with my fianc√© and then I wamted to focus on my programming but my 6 year old laptop was very slow so I decided to treat myself to a new laptop. It had Linux as an OS and I spent my time installing Windows 10 and configuring it for programming.

## Day - 15 - 12.08.2018
Today I spent most of my time on setting up my new laptop. I also messed with flexbox some more along with navigation.

## Day - 16 - 13.08.2018
I messed with flexbox for the navigation and wrote it for mobile and bigger screens. Afterwards I installed The Witcher 3 GOTY Edition and played that for an hour.

## Day - 17 - 14.08.2018
I finished with flexbox for the form element. Added responsiveness for mobile and bigger screens.

## Day - 18 - 15.08.2018
I over complicated a part of my code with flexbox when It works just fine with 5 lines of regular CSS. Leason learned. Also TI8 started so I spent some time watching DOTA

## Day - 19 - 16.08.2018
Managed to get my Iframe responsive just the way I like it. Also centered my attributes section.

## Day - 20 - 17.08.2018
Finished with my product landing page HTML and CSS.

## Day - 21 - 18.08.2018
Had a few bugs with my HTML and CSS. Fixed it so the project passed all the FCC provided tests. Submited it to freeCodeCamp

## Day - 22 - 19.08.2018
I'm feeling like my CSS skills are a bit rusty so I watched a few tutorials and decided to dedicate half an hour a day to practicing a CSS feature. Started a new git repository for it. Played a bit of The Witcher 3 today too.

## Day - 23 - 20.08.2018
Started my Technical Documentation Page project from FCC. Finished the HTML and did the CSS for mobile devices. A couple of media queries left for bigger screens

## Day - 24 - 21.08.2018

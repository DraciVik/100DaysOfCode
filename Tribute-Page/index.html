                    <strong>10.07.1856</strong>
                </li>
                <li>In
                    <strong>1861</strong>, Tesla attended primary school in Smiljan where he studied German, arithmetic, and religion.</li>
                <li>In
                    <strong>1862</strong>>, the Tesla family moved to the nearby Gospić, Lika where Tesla's father worked as parish
                    priest. Nikola completed primary school, followed by middle school</li>
                <li>In
                    <strong>1870</strong>, Tesla moved far north to Karlovac[25] to attend high school at the Higher Real Gymnasium.
                    The classes were held in German, as it was a school within the Austro-Hungarian Military Frontier. He
                    finished a four-year term in three years, graduating in 1873</li>
                <li>In
                    <strong>1873</strong>, Tesla returned to Smiljan. Shortly after he arrived, he contracted cholera, was bedridden
                    for nine months and was near death multiple times. Tesla's father, in a moment of despair, (who had originally
                    wanted him to enter the priesthood)promised to send him to the best engineering school if he recovered
                    from the illness.</li>
                <li>In
                    <strong>1881</strong>, Tesla moved to Budapest, Hungary, to work under Tivadar Puskás at a telegraph company,
                    the Budapest Telephone Exchange. Upon arrival, Tesla realized that the company, then under construction,
                    was not functional, so he worked as a draftsman in the Central Telegraph Office instead. Within a few
                    months, the Budapest Telephone Exchange became functional, and Tesla was allocated the chief electrician
                    position.</li>
                <li>in
                    <strong>1882</strong>, Tivadar Puskás got Tesla another job in Paris with the Continental Edison Company.[38]
                    Tesla began working in what was then a brand new industry, installing indoor incandescent lighting citywide
                    in the form of an electric power utility</li>
                <li>In
                    <strong>1884</strong>, Edison manager Charles Batchelor, who had been overseeing the Paris installation, was
                    brought back to the US to manage the Edison Machine Works, a manufacturing division situated in New York
                    City, and asked that Tesla be brought to the US as well.</li>

                <li>In
                    <strong>1887</strong>>, Tesla developed an induction motor that ran on alternating current (AC)</li>
                <li>On
                    <strong>30 July 1891</strong>, aged 35, Tesla became a naturalized citizen of the United States. In the same
                    year, he patented his Tesla coil.</li>
                <li>In
                    <strong>1895</strong>, Edward Dean Adams, impressed with what he saw when he toured Tesla's lab, agreed to help
                    found the Nikola Tesla Company, set up to fund, develop, and market a variety of previous Tesla patents
                    and inventions as well as new ones. Alfred Brown signed on, bringing along patents developed under Peck
                    and Brown. The board was filled out with William Birch Rankine and Charles F. Coaney.[116] It found few
                    investors; the mid-1890s was a tough time financially, and the wireless lighting and oscillators patents
                    it was set up to market never panned out. The company would handle Tesla's patents for decades to come.</li>
                <li>On
                    <strong>7 January 1943</strong>, at the age of 86, Tesla died alone in Room 3327 of the New Yorker Hotel. His
                    body was later found by maid Alice Monaghan after she had entered Tesla's room, ignoring the "do not
                    disturb" sign that Tesla had placed on his door two days earlier. Assistant medical examiner H.W. Wembley
                    examined the body and ruled that the cause of death had been coronary thrombosis.</li>

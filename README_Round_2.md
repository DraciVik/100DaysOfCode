# 100DaysOfCode

Round 2 ready to start from 08.11.2018

## Day - 1 - 08.11.2018

Today I watched a couple of videos on React and did some of the functional programming challenges on #freeCodeCamp Looking forward to being more active on this round 2. The first 100 days were good even though I neglected to post daily on twitter.

## Day - 2 - 09.11.2018

Decided that I'll need to start applying to new jobs around February or March so I can change careers so I enrolled in a specialization course on React on Coursera. Watched trough some of the tutorials.

## Day - 3 - 10.11.2018

Worked trough some tutorials on npm and git. I thought it would be boring since I was familiar with both, but I actually learned a thing or two. Also solved a 6kyu kata on codewars.

## Day - 4 - 11.11.2018

Finished all the videos from week one of a course on Coursera. I plan on finishing the assignment on day 5.

## Day - 5 - 12.11.2018

Messed around with bootstrap for a bit and downloaded a few tutorials about bootstrap to binge watch when I have time. Tried my hand again with functional programming and I'm getting a better understanding at each try

## Day - 6 - 13.11.2018

Solved my first weeks assignment from Coursera

## Day - 7 - 14.11.2018

Solved a couple of codewars challenges and a few freeCodeCamp functional programming

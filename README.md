# 100DaysOfCode
This is where I'll keep my daily logs of the 100 days of code challenge

## Day - 0 - 28.07.2018
I made an instagram account where I'll put pictures of my progress and connect with likeminded people.
From tomorrow I'll start working on some projects. Probably will start from the freeCodeCamp ones and work myself upwards. Till tomorrow!

## Day - 1 - 29.07.2018
I started the Tribute page project from freeCodeCamp. Added the HTML. Only CSS left for the project. I plan on finishing the CSS tomorrow

## Day - 2 - 30.07.2018
Finished the Tribute page project from freeCodeCamp.
Finished with adding the CSS. All in all it was a quick easy project. Next up is the build a survey form.

## Day - 3 - 31.07.2018
Started the Survey Form project from freeCodeCamp.
Started adding the input fields. I also added my first instagram picture. It was of the finished Tribute page project.

## Day - 4 - 01.08.2018
Finished the HTML of the Survey Form. It passes all the test from codepen so technically the challenge is done. It loks ugly tho so I'll spend some time with CSS on it.

## Day - 5 - 02.08.2018
Finished the CSS for the Survey Form. Now it's not as ugly. Still ugly tho.

## Day - 6 - 03.08.2018
Started a new project - Product landing page. This one requires of me to use media queries and flexbox. Today I just wrote the HTML for the page with some placeholder text. Tomorrow is Saturday and I'm off from work so I'll spend a bit more time on this project so I can finish it. 

## Day - 7 - 04.08.2018
Today I took some refreshment on CSS flexbox. Previously I got so into JavaScript and React that I have forgotten how to use it. I spent couple of hours going trough the freeCodeCamp section on CSS Flexbox and watched some Wes Bos clips for it too. I think I have it now. I meddled with the CSS for the Product Landing Page challenge but I did not like it one bit so I scraped my progress. I will work on it the next day.

## Day - 8 - 05.08.2018
Added flexbox to my navigation and the submit form. In the meantime I solved all the responsive design challenges from freeCodeCamp. Was a good reminder especially the part about transitions and animations. I need to practice that more often

### Did not update this log for this round but everything is on my (twitter)[https://twitter.com/DraciVik] account.

I stopped in the early days of round 4 bacuse a house burned down in my family so I spent 3 months working on building a new house every single day until it was rebuilt. 

Had a great time with this challenge and I think I'll start again someday because it helps accomplish so much.
